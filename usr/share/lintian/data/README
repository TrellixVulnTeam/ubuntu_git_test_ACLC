This directory contains files loaded by the Lintian::Data module,
specifically lists of keywords used in various Lintian checks.  For all
files in this directory, blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning
with #.

For each list of keywords, please include in a comment the origin of the
list, any information about how to resynchronize the list with that
origin, and any special exceptions or caveats.

Files should generally be organized into subdirectory by check or by
general class of lists (for example, all lists related to doc-base files
should go into a doc-base subdirectory).
