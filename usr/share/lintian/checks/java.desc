Check-Script: java
Author: Vincent Fourmond <fourmond@debian.org>
Abbrev: java
Type: binary
Needs-Info: java-info, unpacked
Info: This script checks if the packages comply with various aspects of the
 Debian Java policy.

Tag: classpath-contains-relative-path
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The classpath listed in the jar file refers to a potential
 missing jar file.  This could be the remnants of a build-time
 classpath that are not relevant for a JAR bundled in a Debian
 package.
 .
 Alternatively, the classpath may be correct, but the package is
 lacking a jar file or a symlink to it.
 .
 Note, Lintian assumes that all (relative) classpaths pointing to
 /usr/share/java/ (but not subdirs thereof) are satisfied by
 dependencies as long as there is at least one strong libX-java
 dependency.

Tag: jar-not-in-usr-share
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: java-policy 2.2, java-policy 2.3
Info: The classpath listed in some of the files references files outside
 of /usr/share, while all installed JAR files must be within
 /usr/share/java for libraries or /usr/share/<i>package</i> for JARs for
 private use.
 .
 The rationale is that jar files are in almost all cases architecture
 independent and therefore should be in /usr/share.  If the jar file is
 truly architecture dependent or it cannot be moved since symlinked jar
 files are not accepted by the application, then please override this
 tag.

Tag: maven-plugin-in-usr-share-java
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: A maven plugin is incorrectly installed in /usr/share/java.
 Maven plugins should be installed in /usr/share/maven-repo

Tag: executable-jar-without-main-class
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: java-policy 2.2
Info: An executable JAR must have a Main-Class set in its manifest.

Tag: missing-dep-on-jarwrapper
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: java-policy 2.2
Info: Packages containing an executable JAR must depend on jarwrapper or
 other packages providing similar functionalities.

Tag: missing-classpath
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: None of the jar files contained in the package declare a Class-Path
 in their manifest, but the package depends on at least one java library.
 That means that either the dependency is not needed or at least one of
 the JARs should include a classpath.
 .
 It is important to keep the classpath up-to-date to allow the
 automatic detection of dependencies at run time. Having a Class-Path
 element in the manifest allows for painless transitions if the class
 path of the dependencies of the library ever changes.
 .
 Failing to do that means that for every change in class path, all
 rdepends must update their wrapper scripts, which is a lot of work
 for nothing.

Tag: javalib-but-no-public-jars
Severity: minor
Certainty: possible
Info: The name of the package suggests that it contains a java library but
 it does not contain any JAR file in /usr/share/java, while the java policy
 mandates that JAR files outside /usr/share/java are for private use.

Tag: missing-manifest
Severity: minor
Certainty: possible
Info: The jar file contains .class files but no manifest. This may
 indicate a build misconfiguration.

Tag: codeless-jar
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The jar file contains a manifest but no code. This probably indicates
 that something went wrong at build-time.

Tag: incompatible-java-bytecode-format
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The package contains Java class files with a minimum requirement on the
 listed Java version.  This Java version is not supported by the default JVM
 in Debian and is therefore likely to be a mistake.
Ref: #673276

Tag: unknown-java-class-version
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a Jar file with Java class files compiled for an
 unknown Java version.  Most likely the class file is corrupt or compiled
 for a newer version of Java than Lintian knows about.  In the latter case,
 please file a bug against Lintian.
 .
 The latest class version known by Lintian is Java8 (Major version 52).

Tag: zip-parse-error
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package contains a Jar file, but Lintian is unable to parse it.
 It is possible that the Jar file is corrupt.
