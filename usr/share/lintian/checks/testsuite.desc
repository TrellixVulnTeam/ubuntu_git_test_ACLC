Tag: debian-tests-control-is-not-a-regular-file

Tag: debian-tests-control-uses-national-encoding
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The debian/tests/control file should be valid UTF-8, an encoding
 of the Unicode character set.
 .
 There are many ways to convert a file from an encoding like
 ISO-8859-1; you may for example use "iconv" like:
 .
  $ iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 file &gt; file.new
  $ mv file.new file

Tag: inconsistent-testsuite-field
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: The package provides a debian/tests/control file but no
 Testsuite field in the dsc file, or the field exists but not the
 file.
 .
 For discoverability, packages shipping tests for the autopkgtest
 testing framework should declare their presence in the package
 dsc file by adding "Testsuite: autopkgtest" to their debian/control.

Tag: testsuite-dependency-has-unparsable-elements
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: Lintian cannot parse the Depends field for the given autopkgtest.
 .
 Please double check that dependency the syntax is correct.
 .
 Note that Lintian has a whitelist of known "special" dependencies
 permitted by autopkgtest (e.g. @builddep@).  Lintian does not accept
 these as a part of an OR-clause.
 .
 If Lintian complains about a new special "@"-dependency, please file
 a bug against Lintian and have it added to the whitelist.
