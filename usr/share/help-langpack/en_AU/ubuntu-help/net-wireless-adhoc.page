<title>Create a wireless hotspot</title>

<p>You can use your computer as a wireless hotspot. This allows other devices to
connect to your computer without a separate network. If your computer has a connection to the internet other than wireless, 
you can use the wireless hotspot to share your internet connection with other devices.</p>

<steps>

  <item>
    <p>Click the <em>system menu</em> <media type="image" mime="image/svg" src="figures/system-devices-panel.svg">Power cog icon</media> and
    select <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p>
  </item>

  <item><p>Open <gui>Network</gui> and select <gui>Wireless</gui> on the left.</p></item>

  <item><p>Click the <gui>Use as Hotspot...</gui> button.</p></item>

  <item><p>If you are already connected to a wireless network, you will be asked
  if you want to disconnect from that network. A single wireless adapter can only
  connect to or create one network at a time. Click <gui>Turn On</gui> to
  confirm.</p></item>

</steps>

<p>A wireless network name (SSID) and security key are automatically generated.
The SSID is based on the name of your computer. Other devices
will need the SSID and security key in order to connect to the hotspot you've just created.
If you wish to, you can change the SSID and security key.</p>
