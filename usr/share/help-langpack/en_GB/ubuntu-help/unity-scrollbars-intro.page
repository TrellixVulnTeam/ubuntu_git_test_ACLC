<title>What are overlay scrollbars?</title>

<p>Ubuntu includes <em>overlay scrollbars</em> which take up less screen space than traditional scrollbars, giving you more room for your content. While inspired by mobile devices where traditional scrollbars aren't needed, Ubuntu's overlay scrollbars are designed to work just as well with a mouse.</p>

<p>Some applications like Firefox and LibreOffice do not support the new scrollbars yet.</p>

  <title>Use the scrollbars</title>

  <p>The overlay scrollbar appears as a thin orange strip at the edge of a scrollable area. The position of the scrollbar corresponds with your screen's position in the scrollable content. The strip length corresponds with the content length; the shorter the strip, the longer the content.</p>

  <p>Move your mouse pointer over any point on the scrollable edge of the content to reveal the <gui>thumb slider</gui>.</p>

    <title>Ways to use the scrollbars:</title>
    <item><p>Drag the <gui>thumb slider</gui> up or down to move the screen's position exactly where you want it.</p></item>
    <item><p>Click the scrollbar to move the screen's position exactly where you want it.</p></item>
