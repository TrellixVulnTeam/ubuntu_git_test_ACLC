>&#13;        Packaging has become complicated&#8212;not because dpkg is
        complicated (indeed, dpkg-deb is very simple to use) but
        because of the high requirements of our policy. If a developer
        releases a new package, she has to consider hundreds of
        guidelines to make the package `policy compliant.'
      </P
><P
>&#13;        All parts of our policy have been introduced by the same procedure:
        Some developer has a good idea how to make packages more `unique' with
        respect to a certain aspect&#8212;then the idea is discussed and a policy
        proposal is prepared. If we have a consensus about the policy change,
        it's introduced in our manuals.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Therefore, our policy is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>not</I
></SPAN
> designed to
        make life harder for the maintainers! The intention is to make
        Debian the best Linux distribution out there. With this in
        mind, lots of policy changes are discussed on the mailing
        lists each week.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        But changing the policy is only a small part of the story:
        Just having some statement included in the manual does not
        make Debian any better. What's needed is for that policy to
        become `real life,' i.e.,
        it's <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>implemented</I
></SPAN
> in our packages. And
        this is where Lintian comes in: Lintian checks packages and
        reports possible policy violations. (Of course, not everything
        can be checked mechanically &#8212; but a lot of things can
        and this is what Lintian is for.)

></SPAN
>
          </P
><P
>&#13;            From the results of the first two Lintian checks I
            implemented, I see that there is a big need to make this
            gap smaller. Introducing more policy aspects is worthless
            unless they are implemented. We first should fix packages
            to comply with current policy before searching for new
            ways to make policy more detailed. (Of course, there are
            also important policy changes that need to be introduced
            &#8212; but this is not what's meant here.)

>&#13;            For example, it could turn out that some ideas that once
            sounded great in theory are hard to implement in all our
            packages &#8212; in which case we should rework this
            aspect of policy.

>&#13;            Being humans, it's natural for us to make errors. Since we
            all have the ability to learn from our mistakes, this is
            actually no big problem.  Once an important bug is
            discovered, a Lintian check could be written to check for
            exactly this bug. This will prevent the bug from appearing
            in any future revisions of any of our packages.
