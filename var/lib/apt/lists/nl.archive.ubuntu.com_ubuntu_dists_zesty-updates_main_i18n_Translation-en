Description-en: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.9.8.

Description-en: QEMU full system emulation binaries (s390x)
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 s390x emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves reasonable
 speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides the full system emulation binaries to emulate
 the following s390x hardware:  s390x.
 .
 In system emulation mode QEMU emulates a full system, including a processor
 and various peripherals.  It enables easier testing and debugging of system
 code.  It can also be used to provide virtual hosting of several virtual
 machines on a single server.
