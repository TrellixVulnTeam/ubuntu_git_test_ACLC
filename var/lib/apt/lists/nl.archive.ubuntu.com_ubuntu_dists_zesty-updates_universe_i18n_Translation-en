 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other

 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Description-md5: aa1e199f804671c670cc9ac058725654
Description-en: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (emacs support)
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides two modules for integration with Emacs:
 .
  * git.el:
 .
    Status manager that displays the state of all the files of the
    project and provides easy access to the most frequently used git
    commands. The user interface is intended to be similar to the
    pcl-cvs mode. It can be started with `M-x git-status'.
 .
  * git-blame.el:
 .
    Emacs implementation of incremental "git blame".  When you turn it
    on while viewing a file, the editor buffer will be updated by
    setting the background of individual lines to a color that reflects
    which commit it comes from.
 .
 This package does not contain the VC-mode backend for git. That is
 part of standard Emacs distributions, starting with version 22.2.

 lomoco can configure vendor-specific options on Logitech USB mice (or
 dual-personality mice plugged into the USB port). A number of recent
 devices are supported. The program is mostly useful in setting the
 resolution to 800 cpi or higher on mice that boot at 400 cpi (such as
 the MX500, MX510, MX1000 etc.), and disabling SmartScroll or Cruise
 Control for those who would rather use the two extra buttons as ordinary
 mouse buttons. It can also retrieve battery level from wireless mice.

 and no dependencies to other libraries such as XML parsers or HTTP
 implementations. All the code is pure ANSI C. Compiled on a x86 PC, the
 miniupnp client library have less than 15KB code size. For instance, the upnpc
 sample program is around 20KB. The miniupnp daemon is much smaller than any
 other IGD daemon and is ideal for using on low memory device for this reason.
